word_count: 4500
order: 4

overview: |
  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent the convergence of large language models,
  computer vision, and robotic control. This final module teaches how to integrate LLMs
  (GPT, Claude) with robotic systems to enable natural language commands, task planning,
  and adaptive behavior in unstructured environments.

learning_outcomes:
  - Understand Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model architectures
  - Integrate LLMs with ROS 2 for task planning
  - Use speech recognition (Whisper) for voice control
  - Design multi-modal reward functions
  - Build end-to-end autonomous systems
  - Deploy conversational robots with LLM reasoning
