word_count: 4000
order: 1

overview: |
  ROS 2 is the middleware that connects digital controllers to physical (or simulated) robots.
  This module explains ROS 2's architecture, core concepts (nodes, topics, services), and 
  how to build practical Python packages that control humanoid robots.

learning_outcomes:
  - Understand ROS 2 middleware architecture and design principles
  - Create and manage ROS 2 nodes using Python (rclpy)
  - Implement publishers, subscribers, and services
  - Write URDF descriptions for humanoid robots
  - Deploy ROS 2 control systems to edge hardware
