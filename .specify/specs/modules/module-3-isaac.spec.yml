overview: |
  NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem (Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS) brings AI-accelerated perception, planning,
  and control to robots. This module covers synthetic data generation, hardware-accelerated
  SLAM, navigation, and reinforcement learning—enabling robots to perceive and navigate
  complex, dynamic environments.
