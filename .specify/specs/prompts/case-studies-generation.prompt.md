# Prompt spec for Case Studies chapter generation

## Purpose

Generate reproducible case studies demonstrating AI-native, spec-driven workflows in enterprise and academic contexts.

- Target word count: ~800 words.
- Provide reproducibility artifacts (e.g., spec snippets, commands, expected metrics).
- Maintain Flesch-Kincaid grade 10–12.
- Use APA 7th edition citation markers.

## Output

Markdown formatted chapter suitable for `book/docs/case-studies.md` with a References anchor.
