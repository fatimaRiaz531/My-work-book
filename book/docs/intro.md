# Introduction to AI-Native Software Development

## Abstract

This research paper presents a comprehensive analysis of AI-native software development through the lens of Spec-Driven Development (SDD). As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into the software development lifecycle, this work explores the theoretical foundations, practical applications, and implementation patterns that define modern software engineering in the age of AI.

**Word Count Target:** 5,000–7,000 words  
**Academic Level:** Computer Science Graduate/Researcher  
**Key Audience:** Software engineers, computer scientists, and technology leaders

## Purpose and Scope

This paper addresses the critical need for rigorous academic treatment of AI-native development practices. While industry adoption of AI tools continues to accelerate, scholarly literature on their integration into formal software development methodologies remains sparse. This research bridges that gap by:

1. Defining AI-native software development within established computer science frameworks
2. Detailing the Spec-Driven Development methodology and its alignment with AI capabilities
3. Examining tools and technologies that enable AI-enhanced development workflows
4. Presenting real-world implementation patterns and case studies
5. Proposing best practices for academic and industry applications

## Key Academic Standards

This research adheres to:

- **Plagiarism Tolerance:** 0%
- **Citation Format:** APA 7th edition
- **Readability Level:** Flesch-Kincaid Grade 10–12
- **Source Quality:** Minimum 50% peer-reviewed academic sources
